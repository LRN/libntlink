This pure WinAPI/MSVCRT-based library implements equivalents of the following
functions:
symlink()
link()
unlink()
lstat()
readlink()

When compiled for Vista or later, it uses built-in CreateSymbolicLink() and
related API functions. When compiled for XP, it tries to implement symbolic
linking as best as it can with hardlinks (for files) and junction points (for
directories).

A small utility (junc.exe) is provided that is capable of creating/removing
links and reading link information.

Run make-mingw.cmd to compile.
Run make-mingw.cmd DEBUG=1 to build debug version.
Run make-mingw.cmd clean to remove compiled files.

Requires GCC and win32api MinGW packages.
